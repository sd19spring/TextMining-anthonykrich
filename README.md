# TextMining-anthonykrich
Description: Pull transcripts of all public US presidential speeches from the Miller Center website and count the mentions of foreign nations for each president.
All project packages needed can be installed by running the program. 
Instructions: Uncomment all 44 of the create_president_txt statements starting at line 59 in order to create text files on your computer that you can run the analysis on. Pulling from the website is very time consuming and I didn't want to pull too many times, so the text files are downloaded before the analysis is run. Be sure to recomment the 44 statements after the files are downloaded so that you don't create the text files again while running the analysis.
