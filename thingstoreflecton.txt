Presidents with more speeches will most likely have more mentions of foreign nations.
Titles of the speeches are in the text file, for example Washington's "Talk to the Cherokee Nation."
This skews the count of the number of mentions of a foreign nation because I have the titles of
the speeches show up a few times in the text documents under "Previous speech" or "Next speech"
as I scrape.
I definitely could have figured out a way to count the number of speeches the president has,
start at "First inaugural address," which is every president's first speech, and input that into
my create_president_txt function, but I just manually counted and inputed the first speech url.
Not all of the speeches where when the presidents were in office, such as Reagan's 1964 speech in
support of Barry Goldwater for president.
